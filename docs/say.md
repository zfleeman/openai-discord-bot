## `!say`

The `!say` command makes the bot speak whatever text is provided after the command. The text is converted to speech and played in the voice channel the bot is connected to.

You can make the bot sound ridiculous by typing in all caps with a lot of vowels and exclamation points.

Example:
```
!say OHHHHHH YEAAAAAAA BROOOOOO I HAVE HAD HUUUUGE!!! FUN!!!! BIGGGGG TIMEEEEE!
```
