```plaintext
!say <text_to_speech>
```
The `!say` command makes the bot speak whatever text is provided after the command. The text is converted to speech, and the bot will reply to your message with a `.wav` file. If the bot is in a voice channel, it will speak the message in the voice channel.

**Hint**: You can make the bot sound ridiculous by typing in all caps with a lot of vowels and exclamation points.
### Example
```
!say OHHHHHH YEAAAAAAA BROOOOOO I HAVE HAD HUUUUGE!!! FUN!!!! BIGGGGG TIMEEEEE!
```
